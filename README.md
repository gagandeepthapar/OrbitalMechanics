# Orbital Mechanics
Set of Orbital Mechanics functions transcribed from MATLAB or textbooks in Python to support larger Orbital Mechanics projects and classes.

## Structure
The repository is broken up into 5 main categories:

- Basic Orbital Mechanics
- Rendezvous/Relative Motion Mechanics 
- Perturbational Effects 
- Observations/Filtering
- Optimal Transfer

This structure closely follows the breakdown of the Orbital Mechanics path at California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo: AERO 351 (Basic Orbital Mechanics), AERO 452 (Rendezvous/Relative Motion, Perturbational Effects), and AERO 557 (Observations/Filtering, Optimal Transfer).

## Approach
The approach in building this repository was to avoid using unnecessary classes and containers to minimize the learning curve. That being said, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and Pandas are heavily used throughout the repository to enable the math to be simply executed
